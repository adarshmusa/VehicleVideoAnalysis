In this folder, we have all the files we had made during the hackathon which were on my (Adarsh Musa's) device's local storage.

All files which you guys had made during the event should be uploaded inside a folder with your name in the title inside the "Till-Hackathon" folder.

All new files made henceforth will be kept in the "Major-Project" folder, for clean, clear and simple navigation for all sorts of files.
